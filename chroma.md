    ## Install with AI

    Give the following prompt to Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or your favorite AI agent. It will quickly set you up with Chroma.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```prompt Chroma Cloud expandable theme={null}
      In this directory create a new Python project with Chroma set up.
      Use a virtual environment.

      Write a small example that adds some data to a collection and queries it.
      Do not delete the data from the collection when it's complete.
      Run the script when you are done setting up the environment and writing the
      script. The output should show what data was ingested, what was the query,
      and the results.
      Your own summary should include this output so the user can see it.

      First, install `chromadb`.

      The project should be set up with Chroma Cloud. When you install `chromadb`,
      you get access to the Chroma CLI. You can run `chroma login` to authenticate.
      This will open a browser for authentication and save a connection profile
      locally.

      You can also use `chroma profile show` to see if the user already has an
      active profile saved locally. If so, you can skip the login step.

      Then create a DB using the CLI with `chroma db create chroma-getting-started`.
      This will create a DB with this name.

      Then use the CLI command `chroma db connect chroma-getting-started --env-file`.
      This will create a .env file in the current directory with the connection
      variables for this DB and account, so the CloudClient can be instantiated
      with chromadb.CloudClient(api_key=os.getenv("CHROMA_API_KEY"), ...).
      ```

      ```text OSS expandable theme={null}
      In this directory create a new Python project with Chroma set up.
      Use a virtual environment.

      Write a small example that adds some data to a collection and queries it.
      Do not delete the data from the collection when it's complete.
      Run the script when you are done setting up the environment and writing the
      script. The output should show what data was ingested, what was the query,
      and the results.
      Your own summary should include this output so the user can see it.

      Use Chroma's in-memory client: `chromadb.Client()`
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    ## Install Manually

    <Steps titleSize="h3">
      <Step title="Install">
        <CodeGroup>
          ```bash pip theme={null}
          pip install chromadb
          ```

          ```bash poetry theme={null}
          poetry add chromadb
          ```

          ```bash uv theme={null}
          uv pip install chromadb
          ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create a Chroma Client">
        ```python Python theme={null}
        import chromadb
        chroma_client = chromadb.Client()
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create a collection">
        Collections are where you'll store your embeddings, documents, and any additional metadata. Collections index your embeddings and documents, and enable efficient retrieval and filtering. You can create a collection with a name:

        ```python Python theme={null}
        collection = chroma_client.create_collection(name="my_collection")
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add some text documents to the collection">
        Chroma will store your text and handle embedding and indexing automatically. You can also customize the embedding model. You must provide unique string IDs for your documents.

        ```python Python theme={null}
        collection.add(
            ids=["id1", "id2"],
            documents=[
                "This is a document about pineapple",
                "This is a document about oranges"
            ]
        )
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Query the collection">
        You can query the collection with a list of query texts, and Chroma will return the n most similar results. It's that easy!

        ```python Python theme={null}
        results = collection.query(
            query_texts=["This is a query document about hawaii"], # Chroma will embed this for you
            n_results=2 # how many results to return
        )
        print(results)
        ```

        If n\_results is not provided, Chroma will return 10 results by default. Here we only added 2 documents, so we set n\_results=2.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Inspect Results">
        From the above - you can see that our query about hawaii is semantically most similar to the document about pineapple.

        ```python Python theme={null}
        {
          'documents': [[
              'This is a document about pineapple',
              'This is a document about oranges'
          ]],
          'ids': [['id1', 'id2']],
          'distances': [[1.0404009819030762, 1.243080496788025]],
          'uris': None,
          'data': None,
          'metadatas': [[None, None]],
          'embeddings': None,
        }
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Try it out yourself">
        What if we tried querying with "This is a document about florida"? Here is a full example.

        ```python Python expandable theme={null}
        import chromadb
        chroma_client = chromadb.Client()

        # switch \`create_collection\` to \`get_or_create_collection\` to avoid creating a new collection every time
        collection = chroma_client.get_or_create_collection(name="my_collection")

        # switch \`add\` to \`upsert\` to avoid adding the same documents every time
        collection.upsert(
            documents=[
                "This is a document about pineapple",
                "This is a document about oranges"
            ],
            ids=["id1", "id2"]
        )

        results = collection.query(
            query_texts=["This is a query document about florida"], # Chroma will embed this for you
            n_results=2 # how many results to return
        )

        print(results)
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ## Next steps

    In this guide we used Chroma's [in-memory client](/docs/run-chroma/clients#in-memory-client) for simplicity. It starts a Chroma server in-memory, so any data you ingest will be lost when your program terminates. You can use the [persistent client](/docs/run-chroma/clients#persistent-client) or run Chroma in [client-server mode](/docs/run-chroma/client-server) if you need data persistence.

    ## Install with AI

    Give the following prompt to Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or your favorite AI agent. It will quickly set you up with Chroma.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```prompt Chroma Cloud expandable theme={null}
      In this directory create a new Typescript project with Chroma set up.

      Write a small example that adds some data to a collection and queries it.
      Do not delete the data from the collection when it's complete.
      Run the script when you are done setting up the environment and writing the

      and the results.
      Your own summary should include this output so the user can see it.

      You will have to run a local Chroma server to make this work. When you install
      `chromadb` you get access to the Chroma CLI, which can start a local server
      for you with `chroma run`.

      Make sure to instruct the user on how to start a local Chroma server in your
      summary.

          ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create a Chroma Client">
        Run the Chroma backend:

        <CodeGroup>
          ```bash npm theme={null}
          npx chroma run --path ./getting-started
          ```

          ```bash pnpm theme={null}

          docker run -p 8000:8000 chromadb/chroma
          ```
        </CodeGroup>

        Then create a client which connects to it:

        <CodeGroup>
          ```typescript TypeScript ESM theme={null}
          import { ChromaClient } from "chromadb";
          const client = new ChromaClient();

    ## Install Manually

    ```bash  theme={null}
    cargo add chroma
    ```

    ## Create a Chroma Client

    Run the Chroma backend:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    chroma run --path ./getting-started
    ```

    Then create a client which connects to it:

    ```rust  theme={null}
    use chroma::ChromaHttpClient;

    let client = ChromaHttpClient::new(Default::default());
    ```

    ## Create a collection

    ```rust  theme={null}
    let collection = client
        .create_collection("my_collection", None, None)
        .await?;
    ```

    ## Add some text documents to the collection

    The Rust client expects embeddings to be provided directly. Generate embeddings with your provider SDK, then pass them along with documents.

    ```rust  theme={null}
    let embeddings = vec![vec![0.1, 0.2, 0.3], vec![0.4, 0.5, 0.6]];

    collection
        .add(
            vec!["id1".to_string(), "id2".to_string()],
            embeddings,
            Some(vec![
                Some("This is a document about pineapple".to_string()),
                Some("This is a document about oranges".to_string()),
            ]),
            None,
            None,
        )
        .await?;
    ```

    ## Query the collection

    ```rust  theme={null}
    let results = collection
        .query(vec![vec![0.1, 0.2, 0.3]], Some(2), None, None, None)

# Chroma Cloud

Our fully managed hosted service, **Chroma Cloud** is here. [Sign up for free](https://trychroma.com/signup?utm_source=docs-getting-started).

**Chroma Cloud** is a managed offering of [Distributed Chroma](/docs/overview/architecture), operated by the same database and search engineers who designed the system. Under the hood, it's the exact same Apache 2.0-licensed Chroma-no forks, no divergence, just the open-source engine running at scale. Chroma Cloud is serverless - you don't have to provision servers or think about operations, and is billed [based on usage](/cloud/pricing)

### Easy to use and operate

Chroma Cloud is designed to require minimal configuration while still delivering top-tier performance, scale, and reliability. You can get started in under 30 seconds, and as your workload grows, Chroma Cloud handles scaling automatically-no tuning, provisioning, or operations required. Its architecture is built around a custom Rust-based execution engine and high-performance vector and full-text indexes, enabling fast query performance even under heavy loads.

### Reliability

Reliability and accuracy are core to the design. Chroma Cloud is thoroughly tested, with production systems achieving over 90% recall and being continuously monitored for correctness. Thanks to its object storage-based persistence layer, Chroma Cloud is often an order of magnitude more cost-effective than alternatives, without compromising on performance or durability.

### Security and Deployment

Chroma Cloud is SOC 2 Type II certified, and offers deployment flexibility to match your needs. You can sign up for our fully-managed multi-tenant cluster currently running in AWS us-east-1 or contact us for single-tenant deployment managed by Chroma or hosted in your own VPC (BYOC). If you ever want to self-host open source Chroma, we will help you transition your data from Cloud to your self-managed deployment.

### Dashboard

Our web dashboard lets your team work together to view your data, and ensure data quality in your collections with ease. It also serves as a touchpoint for you to view billing data and usage telemetry.

### Advanced Search API

Chroma Cloud introduces a powerful [Search API](/cloud/search-api/overview) that enables hybrid search with advanced filtering, custom ranking expressions, and batch operations. Combine vector similarity with metadata filtering using an intuitive builder pattern or flexible dictionary syntax.

Chroma Cloud is open-source at its core, built on the exact same Apache 2.0 codebase available to everyone. Whether you're building a prototype or running a mission-critical production workload, Chroma Cloud is the fastest path to reliable, scalable, and accurate retrieval.
